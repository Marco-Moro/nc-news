# Instruction to setup environment variables

Before running the project, in the root folder, you need to create two files:

1. `.env.development`
2. `.env.test`

In .env.development add:  PGDATABASE=nc_news

In .env.test add:  PGDATABASE=nc_news_test

These files are used to connect the project to the correct database.
